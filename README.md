# HARD: Hedging Agricultural Risk Dashboard

Open-source **[Dashboard](https://cse6242team45.github.io/)**. It provides an interactive dashboard for farmers and ranchers to gather comprehensive information on agricultural information, including geographic data visualization on yields, production, and sales for a vareity of crops (e.g., wheat, corns, barley, soybeans, and potatoes). Using the data from the **[United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)](https://www.usda.gov/)**, the dashboard also provides price predictions generated by the trained time series models to guide risk management and decision making for farmers and ranchers.

<br />

> Features

- Visualization of `crop production` on the geomap
- Visualization of `crop yields` on the geomap
- Visualization of `crop sales` on the geomap
- `Crop price prediction` from time series models
- `Data download` functionality

## âœ¨ Project Host

The app is hosted by **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**.

<br />

> General steps to host any project on **GitHub Pages**:

- [Create a repo](https://github.com/new) on GitHub
- Clone the repository
- Add, commit, and push your files (e.g., HTML)
- Open a browser and go to https://username.github.io

## âœ¨ Code-base structure

The project is coded using blueprints, app factory pattern, dual configuration profile (development and production), and an intuitive structure presented below:

```bash
